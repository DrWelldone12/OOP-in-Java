/**The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the customer turns in the current calendar year.
 * The premium is computed by taking the decade of the customerâ€™s age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20.
 * For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated by adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20.
 * Write an application that prompts a user for the current year then a birth year.
 * Pass both to a method that calculates and returns the premium amount, and then display the returned amount.  */
