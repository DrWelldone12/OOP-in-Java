/**Herbertâ€™s Home Repair estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job,
 * plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site. The main() method prompts the user for the name of a job (

 * Pass the numeric data to a method that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the main()
